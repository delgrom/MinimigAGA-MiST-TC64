Experimental P96 driver for the Minimig FPGA core.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By Alastair M. Robinson
Huge thanks to the Replay team for releasing their own
P96 driver as open-source - this driver is based heavily
upon their work, and is thus under the same license - LGPL2.1.

V1.1 adds support for screen dragging, removing a couple of ugly hacks
and solving the issue of resyncing when flipping screens.

V1.2 adds support for a VIDEOMEMORY tooltype which can be set to an
integer between 1 and 7 to select how many megabytes the driver reserves
for RTG.  (Please note, if the driver can't allocate a large enough chunk
it will halve the requested size and try again until it succeeds.

V1.3 has a few bug fixes, and now supports vertical autoscrolling.
(Horizontal autoscrolling remains unsupported.)

V1.4 adds a few more pixel clocks (slower ones) to allow for the creation
of lower-res screenmodes suitable for games. (The scandoubler currently
remains unavailable in RTG mode, however.)


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Install P96 using its installer.  You'll be prompted to pick a card
  (any card!) - it shouldn't matter which you choose, but I'll
  assume for the rest of these instructions that you chose PicassoIV.

  The P96 installer will create a new monitor file in Devs:Monitors

* Rename the newly-created "PicassoIV" monitor file to "Minimig"

* Edit the monitor file's tooltypes, changing the BOARDTYPE tooltype
  to minimig then save the changes.

* Optionally add a tooltype, VIDEOMEMORY=<n> to set the amount of used
  video memory to <n> megabytes.

* Copy the minimig.card file to libs:picasso96/

* Optionally, copy the Picasso96Settings file to Devs:
  (The Picasso96Settings file contains some pre-defined screenmodes
  which all work nicely on my Dell U2311H monitor - but may need
  tweaking, or just outright fail to work on other monitors.)

* Reboot, and you should be able to run Picasso96Mode to try out the
  various screenmodes, or select them from within applications.
